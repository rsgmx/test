# Git and ssh

## Concepts

 ` git ` uses different transport protocols one of which is ssh.

 Handling of the private keys and entering passphrases can be simplified by using `ssh-agent`. [[ssh](ssh.md)]

 There is also support for entering the passphrase with GUI/X-programm. See ssh-gui--askpass executable.



## Components

Relevant parts of the ssh-ecoysstem include:
* ``ssh-agent``. Background daemon process used by ssh / git. 
* ``ssh-add``. Adds a specified *identity* to the agent store. Requires to enter the passphrase.

### ssh-agent

Typically you take care a daemonized process `shh-agent` runs.

You can start it manually from the shell:
> `` $ ssh-agent -s``

and add the required identities:
 > ``ssh-add ~/.ssh/[idenityfile] ``

*Identityfile* is one of the private keys generated by ``key-gen``

Typically your bash is set up so that the setup is provided automatically:

``edit file: ~/.profile:``
 ```
 eval `ssh-agent -s` 
 ssh-add ~/.ssh/[idenityfile] 
```


### ssh-keygen

Functions
* generate a key pair
* change passphrase
* export from a key in another format ( see -m)
* sign a certificate


## How-to and FAQ

1. Setup the ssh relevant environment for use in git.

    (a) Get your keypair OR (b)) generate a keypair

    Make the key available to ssh / ssh-agent:
    * move keyfiles to ~/.ssh/    

    make sure ssh-agent gets started for your git-bash
    * edit ~/.profile 

1. Check if ssh-agent is running.

    >``$ ps -al | grep "ssh-agent" ``

2. Check configuration 

3. Add an idenity

4. Create a key-pair

    > ``$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"``

5. Setup configuration of the gitbash


6. Where are key-pairs (*identiy*) stored?
    
   > ``directory: ~/.ssh/ ``

   Check there to see which identities are available.


## windows specifics

-> ssh-agent.exe can be seen in the processexplorer.
